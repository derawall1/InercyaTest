# [SQL](https://github.com/derawall1/InercyaTest/blob/master/SqlQueries.sql) 

## Using the Northwind SQL Server sample database:  

1. Get the list of non-discontinued products including the category name ordered by product name.
2. Display the name of Nancy Davolio's clients.
2. Display the total billed per year for employee Steven Buchanan.
3. Show the name of the employees who report directly or indirectly to Andrew Fuller.

# [Catalog](https://github.com/derawall1/InercyaTest/tree/master/Catalog)

Given the Categories.csv and Products.csv files, develop a console application that reads those files and generates from them the Catalog.json and Catalog.xml files like the ones provided.

# [Random](https://github.com/derawall1/InercyaTest/tree/master/Random)
Develop a console application that generates a text file with 10,000,000 different random 32-bit integers in less than 10 seconds. All 32-bit integers must be equally likely.

# [Customers](https://github.com/derawall1/InercyaTest/tree/master/Customers)
Create a table in SQL Server that corresponds to the data in the Customers.csv file, and develop a console application that loads the data from the file into the table. The final result is the table with the data from the Customers.csv file. ### Used SQLite DB for the ease of testing 

# [WebTreeView](https://github.com/derawall1/InercyaTest/tree/master/WebTreeView)
Given the items.json file which describes a hierarchical structure, develop a web application that reads the file and displays the structure on a page using <ul> and <li> tags as shown in the example WebTreeView.html page. The structure should be shown as fully expanded from the start.
